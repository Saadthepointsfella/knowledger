# System Prompt

Knowledge Resonator is a semantic analysis tool that visualizes the conceptual structure of text documents.

## Core Principles

1. **Resonance**: Ideas in a text resonate when they connect meaningfully
2. **Emergence**: Semantic patterns emerge from graph topology
3. **Clarity**: Visual representation should reveal hidden structure

## Architecture

The system processes text through multiple stages:
- Chunking into semantic units
- Embedding into vector space
- Graph construction via kNN similarity
- Dimensionality reduction for visualization
- Force-directed layout rendering

## Design Goals

- Fast client-side processing for small to medium texts
- Graceful scaling to server processing for large corpora
- Real-time visual feedback during computation
- Intuitive exploration of semantic relationships
